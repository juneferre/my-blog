### What is Tableau? 
   Tableau is one of the most common data visualization tools used in a variety of industries, like finance, healthcare, retail, and technology, to help make data-driven decisions. Its is a platform that allows you to create interactive dashboards by taking raw data and transforming it into understandable visualizations with minimal coding–if any. This tutorial is going to cover how to make 3 basic visualizations–a bar chart, line chart, and scatter plot–in Tableau. 

### Downloading Tableau and Basic Navigation 
     This tutorial is assuming you already have Tableau downloaded. If you're completely new to Tableau, I recommend you go watch [this YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYnkudCxbmE) on how to download Tableau Desktop and learn the basic navigation within Tableau. 

### Importing Data 
     Depending on your file type, you import your data by clicking on an option under the “To a File” subheading in the blue “Connect” sidebar on the left of the homescreen. My data is in a .csv file so I am using the “more” option and selecting my data from a file on my computer. I got my data from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/parulpandey/palmer-archipelago-antarctica-penguin-data).
