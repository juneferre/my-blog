 Hello to my classmates reading this! I'm June Ferre, maybe you've seen me around in class.
Looking at that picture, you might be wondering why I'm holding a wizard staff with a purple
orb? Well, I've come to ease your curiousity.

 I had found it on the internet while very bored in calc 2 and was relating
my professor's apple pen to a wizard sceptor. I then was in search of a realistic-looking
wizard staff. Finally, I stumbled upon a website that beheld the perfect wizard staff--it was 
exactly what I had imagined. Fast-forward to the summer, a month or so before my birthday. My 
friend Connor asked me what I wanted for my birthday, I showed him the staff. He said "I can 
make that happen." I didn't think he was serious. Well, he was serious. So now I have that 
perfect wizard staff with a purple orb, which I now bring to the monthly trivia nights that my
roommate and I host at Pioneer Book.
